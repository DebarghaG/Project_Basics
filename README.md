This repository contains the code for the Project Basics which is a concerned effort to improve the standard of living in underdeveloped and developing countries. 

Project Basics is divided into two different parts-
1.) Project Bat-eye - For people with blindness ,or low  vision so that they don't get themselves into any kind of life - threatening situation. ( It provides the person with basic spatial awareness ). For 5 USD , it's aimed at everyone, irrespective of their income group.

2.) Project Awaaz - For people with speech difficulties, an approach that was as minimalistic as I could possibly create . This repository contains the code to be run on the microcontroller as well as the android phone. 

Please refer to the research papers on https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Debargha_Ganguly2 for detailed information of testing , as well as scientific instructions.

The software and hardware is open source for experimentation / development and academic purposes only. This is supposed to be a not-for profit project ( commercialization is forbidden without the express written permission of Debargha Ganguly ).
